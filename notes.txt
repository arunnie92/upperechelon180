next todo:
- move eno from sheets to microsoft excel
- create one script in Go that reads an excel sheet of eno info to create profile
    e.g. currently one script is in node, another is in go
    https://github.com/360EntSecGroup-Skylar/excelize
- create compareProfile
    each profile is different, different name and/or address from each other for each site, based on phantom documentation
- create CREATE TASKS script
    think this through, this is a big change and requires the prior todo to be finished first

backlog:
    - make sure CCInfo.CardType ony allows the card type strings
    - if virutal card info object is empty then dont create profile
    - really make CreateAddress random usuing all letters of alphabet and digits 0-9
    - clear byte[] of virutal credit card after profiles created?
    - add rules while injesting
        e.g. only have specific strings, strings must be of certain length (anything else or more should error)
    - create ui 
    - this works for phantom but what about other bots?
    - use absolute paths
    - es6 enable but do i need if its all one language?
    - add flags to create profiles for just certain sites  
    - how can i generate my own proxys to use instead of paying for the service
    - what does the data look like for Phantom notification settings
    - add other sites
    - the problem creating manipulating full name
